**Before** you use any tweak(s) ensure you read the comment(s) inside the .reg (labeled with **;**) to see what it really changes. Of course a backup/snapshot could also help in case something goes wrong. Remember: Shit happens!



Project Goal(s)
------------

1. All of the tweaks could be integrated into image creations tools (NTLite, WinToolKit,..) to simplify things, especially if you like to re-install Windows from the ground without need to apply each tweak one by one.
2. Show hidden things that aren't visible via GUI under Windows. Sometimes it's easier/faster to do this via .reg instead of search for the toggles.
3. Another goal is that the user doesn't need additional tools like O&O ShutUp, because some of such 'privacy' tools are bundled with bloatware and are not necessary, because all can already be done with scripts and .reg tweak - So overall an Index/Backup script to read the current state is more transparent (see 1/2).
4. [Provide a short overview of current Windows issue](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/regtweaks/blob/master/Known%20Windows%20Issue.md) and how to quickly solve them.
5. Fix everything listed under ToDo.



RegTweaks is free, but powered by your support
------------

There are many reoccurring costs involved with maintaining free, open source and privacy respecting programs. As you probably know, developing quality applications takes much time and resources. Your sponsoring will make it possible to release the [GUI](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/regtweaks/issues/14).


Any problems, questions or something wrong?
------------

* Feel free to open an [issue ticket](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/regtweaks/issues) and I will look at it asap. - Pull requests or ideas are always welcome!
* Please do not use the issue tracker to ask for xyz tweaks, I not waste my time with that until there is a very good reasons to do so. If you found something that wasn't added here contact me and I will add it.
* Windows 7 - 8 support is limited, I simply don't have time to check every OS and I personally won't support it anymore because my philosophy is to use the latest OS due security reasons.



Find _hidden_ registry settings yourself
------------

To answer the question how do I find all those registry tweaks, it's very easy and explained with pictures and an example video, which you can find over [here](https://chefkochblog.wordpress.com/2018/02/28/how-i-find-every-registry-tweak/).



Reboot myth
------------

There are several myths and misinformation about how the Windows Registry actually work, one of them is that you need to reboot. There are several methods in order to [apply registry changes without a reboot](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-make-registry-changes-take-effect-immediately-without-restart).

* Kill explorer.exe and restart it
* Log off and then log back in (recommend)



Find hidden Windows features yourself
------------

[ViVe Tool](https://github.com/thebookisclosed/ViVe/releases) is not an official Microsoft program. Nevertheless, you can still [download it from it's Github page](https://github.com/riverar/mach2/releases). 

Keep in mind that not all feature IDs can be found within Windows debugging symbols. [Capstone](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone) is still needed in order to disassemble all hidden details.


Win 7 - 10 "Home" Group Policy Editor
------------

The Home Editions doesn't official supporting the GPEDIT.MSC stuff, so here is how to add them back [here's the link how](http://drudger.deviantart.com/art/Add-GPEDIT-msc-215792914) or [this](http://www.askvg.com/how-to-enable-group-policy-editor-gpedit-msc-in-windows-7-home-premium-home-basic-and-starter-editions/).

In order to get RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) in Home Editions simply use [rdpwrap](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/).



File Encoding
------------

All registry (.reg) files are UTF-16 w/o BOM (also called _UCS-2 LE BOM_) encoded, [that's what Windows uses](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/sysinfo/registry-value-types). The line ending is [CRLF](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1552749/difference-between-cr-lf-lf-and-cr-line-break-types). Theoretically you can use UTF-16/UTF-8 with or without BOM but [some people do have some problems](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/regtweaks/issues/20) and that's why I decided to go with the official MS Windows standards.
